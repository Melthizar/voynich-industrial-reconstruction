## Project Overview

**This research project** represents a forensic and cryptographic reconstruction of the Voynich Manuscript (Beinecke MS 408). Moving beyond traditional linguistic or mystical interpretations, this project analyzes the manuscript as a **15th-century Industrial Laboratory Manual** written in a specialized trade-pidgin (Northern Italian/Germanic blend).

This repository contains the complete breakdown of the "Verbose Cipher" used by the author, along with reconstructed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the chemical and mechanical processes depicted in the illustrations.

## **Repository Contents**

### **1. [Linguistic Protocol](voynich_linguistic_protocol.md)**

The Master Decryption Matrix. This document defines:

* **Grammar:** The prefix system (o- for Nouns, y- for Verbs) used to encode technical instructions.
* **Root Dictionary:** The identified industrial roots for chemicals (e.g., Kal for Alkali, Bla for Woad/Blue).
* **Syntax:** The specific thermal and duration markers (-ee, -eee) used to denote boiling and pressure.

### **2. [Technical Analysis & Reconstruction](voynich_technical_analysis.md)**

The comprehensive operational findings. This document includes:

* **Industrial SOPs:** Step-by-step reconstructions of Woad Dyeing, Madder Dyeing, Saponification, and Acid Leaching.
* **Sabotage Analysis:** Evidence of intentional removal of folios 91-92 (Ratios) and 109-110 (Index) to protect trade secrets.
* **Visual Audits:** High-resolution forensic analysis of "mechanical" plants and sorting stations.

## **Key Findings**

* **The "Nymphs":** Identified not as biological figures, but as personifications of **Fiber Bundles** (Linen/Wool) and chemical states within vats.
* **The "Zodiac":** Identified as an **Industrial Production Schedule** linked to seasonal water levels and temperature control (e.g., Aries = Tallow Rendering).
* **Folio 116v:** Decoded as the **Master Dyer's Certification** and Oath, written in a polyglot "Michitonese" shorthand.
* **"Bricked" Security:** The manuscript was rendered unsolvable by the physical removal of the specific "Ratio Pages" that contained the chemical proportions, acting as a 15th-century form of DRM (Digital Rights Management).

## **Methodology**

This project utilizes a **Visual-Linguistic Cross-Reference** methodology. Instead of attempting to translate the text as prose, the text is treated as **Data Compression** (a "ZIP archive" of the era) where repetitive symbols denote cyclical industrial processes.
