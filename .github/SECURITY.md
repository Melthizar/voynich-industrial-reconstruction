## Reporting Issues

This is a historical research project. However, if you discover any content that inadvertently exposes sensitive modern data, violates safety guidelines, or identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the scripts:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2.  Email the lead researcher directly: **Todd A. Vollmer** (<tvollmer@gmail.com>).
3.  Please provide a description of the issue and where it is located.

We are committed to maintaining a safe and responsible research environment.
