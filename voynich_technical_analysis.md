# Technical Analysis and Reconstruction
Industrial and Chemical Reconstruction of the Voynich Manuscript: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis Author: Todd A. Vollmer (tvollmer@gmail.com) Note: This work builds upon and incorporates the fundamental research and "Industrial Manual" hypothesis pioneered by Artyom (The Voynich Engineer from Reddit) (u/Atri_Voynich_Eng).

## 1.  EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY

Analysis of Beinecke MS 408 indicates a highly sophisticated 15th-century industrial laboratory notebook. This document synthesizes operational workflows for textile dyeing, large-scale saponification, and chemical reagent production.

2.  INDUSTRIAL  SOP  RECONSTRUCTIONS  SOP-001:  Woad  Blue  (Bla)  Reduction  
● Process: Cold-vat reduction of 4o-kal-ver-in . 4:1 Potash-to-Woad ratio. ● Oxidation: y-aer-ee (air exposure) triggers blue state change. SOP-002: Madder Red (Ros) High-Heat Dyeing ● Method: y-kee-eee (Max heat) with Alum mordant ( qo-sal-al ). ● Fixation: Steam-setting in tiered pressure basins (Folio 82r). SOP-003: The Mother Lye (Caustic Base) ● Reconstruction: 4:1 ratio of Potash ( Kal ) to Slaked Lime ( Lim ). SOP-004: Saponification (Industrial Soap) ● Graining: y-sal-mic-ut ("Salting Out"). Confirms 57v "Cloud" as soap core. SOP-005: The "Green Lion" Acid (Vitriol) Formulation ● Chemical Basis: Dry distillation of Copper/Iron sulfates to produce leaching agents.

3.  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND  LOGISTICS  (The  "Beryn"  
Site) ● Site Identification: Folio 116v references Beryn ( Börne = Spring/Source). ● Geographic Match: Brixen (Bressanone), South Tyrol. Matches the 1445 "Spring

Privilege" ( Börne-Recht ) granted to dyers.

4.  FORENSIC  SABOTAGE  ANALYSIS  (Intentional  
"Bricking") ● Gaps 91-92: The Mother Lye Ratios. ● Gaps 97-98: The Vitriol/Acid formulas. ● Gaps 109-110: The Master Index.

5.  AUTHENTICATION  (Folio  116v)  
● Master's Certification: o-sig-mag (The Master's Seal). ● Key Phrase: oladabas -> Ol-ada-bas (Oil-Add-Base).

6.  MECHANICAL  ENGINEERING:  THE  FOLIO  82R  
MANIFOLD ● Visual Identity: Nymphs standing in tiered basins. ● Engineering Reconstruction: A Fractional Distillation and Siphon-Settling System .

7.  THE  PHARMACOLOGICAL  BATCH  GRIDS  (Folios  
103-116) ● Industrial Reconstruction: These are Batch Quality Control Ledgers .

8.  FINAL  SYNTHESIS  PREFACE:  THE  SABOTAGE  THAT  
FOOLED HISTORY The "Bricked" Manual Hypothesis This reconstruction demonstrates that the manuscript was rendered "unsolvable" by the physical removal of its decryption keys (Folios 91-92, 97-98, 109-110).

9.  VISUAL  FORENSIC  AUDIT  (HIGH-RES  ANALYSIS)  9.1  Folio  84r  (The  Sorting  Station)  
● Blue Pipe: Vertical supply line connecting tiers. ● Artifacts: Blue Sphere (Woad Cake) and Red Bucket (Madder Paste). ● Conclusion: Manual separation of dyed batches ( ). 9.2 Folio 116v (The Master's Oath)
