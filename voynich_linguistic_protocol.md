# Linguistic Protocol

**Linguistic and Cryptographic Protocol of the Voynich Manuscript**

**Author:** Todd A. Vollmer (tvollmer@gmail.com)
**Note:** This work builds upon and incorporates the fundamental research and "Industrial Manual" hypothesis pioneered by Artem Tishin ([u/Arti_Voynich_Eng](https://www.reddit.com/user/Arti_Voynich_Eng/) | [https://www.youtube.com/@VoynichEngineer](https://www.youtube.com/@VoynichEngineer)).

RECONSTRUCTIONS: We have bridged "Sabotaged Gaps" at 91-92 (Mother Lye Ratios), 97-98 (Acid/Vitriol Formulas), and 109-110 (Master Index). CURRENT STATE: Phase 3 Synthesis Complete. Visual Audits of Folios 84r, 116v, 19v-20r, and 2v-3r are integrated.

## 1. RESEARCH ABSTRACT

This protocol defines the linguistic structure of the Voynich Manuscript as a functional trade-pidgin utilized by 15th-century industrial guilds. The script is identified as a "Verbose Cipher" designed for data compression and trade secrecy.

**The "ZIP Archive" Analogy:**
The text functions similarly to a 15th-century "ZIP archive." Due to the extreme cost of parchment (vellum), the author utilized a system of professional shorthand to maximize information density. Technical terms are compressed into short blocks, acting as a "parts catalog" rather than a narrative text.

**The Inquisition Paradox (Security Rationale):**
*   **Images (Visible):** Can be explained to an Inquisitor as "mythology" or "biblical allegories" (safe).
*   **Text (Encrypted):** Contains specific chemical recipes (e.g., abortifacients, poisons, trade secrets). Direct evidence of heresy or guild theft.
*   **Conclusion:** You encrypt the *recipe* (the evidence), not the *illustration* (the cover story).

## 2. THE FUNCTIONAL MATRIX

### 2.1 Grammar Prefixes (Operational Commands)

| Code | Meaning | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **o- / 4o-** | The Object | Noun marker; denotes a static substance (e.g., `o-Tar` = Resin). |
| **y- / 8-** | To Action | Verb marker; denotes a command or process (e.g., `y-Tar` = To thicken). |
| **qo-** | Instrumental | Denotes the specific tool or catalyst used (e.g., `qo-sal` = using salt). |
| **chk- / sh-** | Audit | Quality control; verification of temperature or purity. |

### 2.2 Core Industrial Roots

| Root | Decoded Meaning | Root | Decoded Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kal** | Alkali / Lye | **Bla** | Blue (Woad) |
| **Sal** | Salt / Mordant | **Ros** | Red (Madder) |
| **Lim** | Lime (Calcium) | **Or** | Yellow (Weld) |
| **Tal** | Tallow (Animal Fat) | **Ver** | Vegetable / Green |
| **Tar** | Tar / Resin | **Lav** | Wash / Rinse |
| **Lin** | Linen / Fiber | **Sol** | Sun / Dry |
| **Fil** | Thread / Filament | **Kee** | Heat / Boil |
| **Alb** | Jar / Albarello | **Sif** | Siphon / Pipe |
| **Val** | Potency / Strength | **Aer** | Air / Oxidation |
| **Mag** | Master / Principal | **Sig** | Seal / Authenticate |

| Root | Decoded Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lex** | Law / Method |
| **Ut** | Out / Discharge |
| **Met** | Measure / Quantity* |
| **Pan** | Batch / Panel* |
| **Rec** | Recipe / Record* |
| **Nom** | Name / Label* |
| **Sep** | Separate / Sort* |
| **Col** | Color / Pigment* |
| **Cap** | Hood / Condenser* |
| **Iso** | Insulate / Scale* |
| **Tan** | Tannin / Gall* |
| **Car** | Card / Tease / Nap* |
| **Muc** | Mucilage / Thickener* |
| **Lay** | Layer / Stratify* |

### 2.3 Thermal and Duration Markers

*   **-e** : Ambient Warmth (`Te`).
*   **-ee** : High Heat / Boiling (`Kee`).
*   **-eee** : Maximum Intensity / Pressure / Distillation.

### 2.4 The "Constructor" Principle (Infographics)
The botanical illustrations are not depictions of biological species but **"assembly drawings"** following a "Constructor" principle:
*   **Root A + Flower B + Leaf C = Recipe Composition.**
*   These are infographics for a "parts catalog." For example, a drawing might combine a specific root (ingredient 1) with a flower from another plant (ingredient 2) to visually represent the composition of a mixture (e.g., an ointment for bone fusion or wound healing).

### 2.5 Case Study: The Etymology of TAR (Trade Pidgin Proof)
The use of the root **TAR** provides linguistic evidence of a "Trade Pidgin" mixing Latin and Germanic roots, typical of Northern Italian/Alpine workshops.

*   **Linguistic Roots:**
    *   Old English: *Teru*
    *   Old Norse: *Tjara*
    *   German/Dutch: *Teer*

*   **The Phonetic Conflict (Why TAR and not TEER?):**
    In this cipher, `e`, `ee`, and `eee` are functional markers for **Heat** and **Boiling** (see Section 2.3). Writing `Teer` would be misread as a command to "Heat" (`Te-`) or "Boil" (`Kee`). To avoid fatal errors in the lab, the author intentionally selected the hard-vowel Germanic variant **TAR** to distinctively encode the substance (Resin/Pitch) without conflicting with thermal instructions.

## 3. CHRONOLOGICAL SCHEDULING (Industrial Calendar)

*   **Aries (Folio 71r):** Tallow Rendering (Fat processing).
*   **Taurus (Folio 70v):** Mineral fixation and mordanting.
*   **Cancer (Folio 70v extension):** "The Reddening" (High-heat madder boiling).
*   **Virgo:** Fiber harvest and flax preparation.
